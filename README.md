This repository contains three Web UIs that a whatsapp-web like web would need: <br/>
1. The login screen <br/>
2. The register screen <br/>
3. The chat screen <br/>
These screens were designed with HTML and CSS. <br/>
The login screen contains 2 input boxes: one for the username and one for the password, a button to submit them, and a redirect button
to register if we arent already registered. <br/>
The register screen contains 3 input boxes: one for the username to login with, one for the password, one for the nickname we want to be shown to the other chatters. Also upon registering, the user shall upload a profile image. The user shall then submit the form with the submit button. Here too. is a redirect button to login, if we are already registered. <br/>
The chat screen shows the user all of his contacts along with their names and profile picture and the last message they sent and when.
Upon choosing a contact, the entire chat with them will show, and the user can scroll up and down.
The user can also add a new contact with the press of a button, which will open a popup where he needs to enter the contacts identifier and submit it. <br/>
